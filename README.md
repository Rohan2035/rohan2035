## Wassup! 👋
I am a Software Developer with 2+ years of experience in Java and Spring Boot. Worked on REST API development, file
processing, SOAP integration, and transaction enrichment for banking systems. Built file watcher service, secured APIs
using Spring Security, and contributed to infrastructure tasks using Terraform with deployments on AWS. Previously
involved in migrating a legacy Mobius-based system to Spring Boot for IBM CMoD, including scripting for OpenShift
deployment. Collaborated directly with client-side leads in a lean offshore team.
